  - `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_file_download.xml`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Created `LogCatcher.kt` with a low-overhead ring buffer, zero-allocation short-circuit when logging is disabled, component lifecycle tracking (`markComponentActive`/`markComponentInactive`), and an uncaught exception trap that writes fatal crash traces synchronously to internal storage (`last_crash.log` and dated history files) to persist across process death.
  2. Refactored `Log.kt` to route through `LogCatcher` and initialized it in `App.kt` and `LatinIME.java`.
  3. Redesigned `LogKeeperActivity.kt` using Jetpack Compose with dual tabs (`Log Keeper` and `All Running`), a persistent crash alert banner, action buttons (`Copy`, `Export`, `Refresh`, `Clear`), and a master enable/disable switch.
  4. Created `sym_keyboard_log_keeper_rounded.xml` and `ic_file_download.xml`, mapped `NAME_LOG_KEEPER_KEY` to `ic_settings_about_log` across Holo, Material, and Rounded icon sets in `KeyboardIconsSet.kt`.
  5. Injected dynamic `!autoColumnOrder!` into `getCommaPopupKeys` in `TextKeyData.kt` so the comma popup forms a compact, neat multi-row grid identical to the period popup.
- **How it was verified**: Local build verified with `compile_applet` (exit code 0, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`).
- **Deviation from requested**: None.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: Ready for on-device manual QA.

## Entry 012
- **Timestamp**: 2026-09-05T13:12:00-07:00
- **Requested**: Safe sidelining (English and French only; layouts except symbol, more symbols, numberpad, clipboard, and emoji moved to sidelined_features; gesture typing, physical keyboard, and other languages sidelined; lock settings to user preset under Option B: Read-Only/Stripped UI; calibrate popup elevation above parent key; no tap popup preview, only long press).
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `/sidelined_features/` (new directory preserving unused layouts, assets, and locale key texts)
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/KeyboardTheme.kt`

  2. Locked default settings in `Defaults.kt` and `SettingsValues.java` according to user's screenshots (Option B): Blue Grey theme, Rounded key style with borders enabled, Auto Day/Night disabled, Navigation Bar coloring disabled, Tap Keypress Popup Preview permanently disabled (`mKeyPreviewPopupOn = false`), Number Row enabled with hints, Clipboard History enabled with 10 min retention and pinned first, Redundant Popups removed, Gesture Typing permanently disabled (`mGestureInputEnabled = false`), and Physical Keyboard Emoji Alt key stripped from UI and defaults.
  3. Added Blue Grey curated palette (#ECEFF1 bg, #FFFFFF keys, #CFD8DC functional keys, #78909C accent, #263238 text) to `ColorsScreen.kt` and `KeyboardTheme.kt`.
  4. Excised `Settings.PREF_ENABLE_EMOJI_ALT_PHYSICAL_KEY` from `AdvancedScreen.kt`.
  5. Calibrated popup elevation in `MainKeyboardView.java` by +16% key height offset to provide a clean floating gap above the parent key on long press.

  1. Re-enabled `armeabi-v7a` in `app/build.gradle.kts` `abiFilters` alongside `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` to support 32-bit userlands on Unisoc devices.
  2. Updated `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` to automatically build `libjni_latinime.so` for `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, and `x86_64` using `ndk-build` before assembling the APK.
  3. Hardened `ExpandableBinaryDictionary.java` with null checks across `isValidDictionaryLocked()`, `getFrequency()`, `runGCIfRequiredLocked()`, `addUnigramLocked()`, `addNgramEntryLocked()`, `loadBinaryDictionaryLocked()`, and `createNewDictionaryLocked()` to permanently prevent NPE crashes even if native dictionary initialization is delayed or unavailable.
  4. Updated `DictionaryFactory.kt` to prevent `killDictionary(file)` from deleting valid dictionary cache files when the native library is not yet loaded.
  5. Redesigned `LogKeeperActivity.kt` to match the user's reference screenshot: top bar with back navigation, bold title, Master Switch, Copy icon button, and Download/Export icon button; 2 tabs: **All Logs** and **Errors**; clean card list with monospace timestamps, component tag badges, colored log level chips, and message text.

- **Requested**: Implement Enter / Bottom row of clipboard in emoji modal; Prompt list (quick notes) modal with 3-option long press (Pin, Edit, Delete), full edit dialog with multiline text field, clipboard move-to-prompt action, and copy toolbar long press; 2-minute temporary incognito mode on incognito toolbar long press that reverts after 2 minutes or upon closing the keyboard.
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/emoji/EmojiPalettesView.java`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/database/PromptDao.kt`

  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/LatinIME.java`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Configured `EmojiPalettesView.java` to use `KeyboardElement.CLIPBOARD_BOTTOM_ROW` (`clip_bottom_row.json`), providing the exact unified bottom row with the Enter / Action key (`[ABC] [Space] [⌫] [↵ / Action]`) beneath emojis.
  2. Implemented `updatePrompt(id, newText)` and listener notification in `PromptDao.kt`.
  3. Added 3-action long-press popup menu (`📌 Pin/Unpin`, `✏️ Edit`, `🗑️ Delete`) to `PromptHistoryView.kt`. Implemented full edit dialog with multiline `EditText`, `Cancel`, and `Save` buttons, bound properly to the IME window token for live typing and in-place updating.
  4. Verified clipboard card long press offers `📌 Pin/Unpin`, `📥 Move to Prompt List`, and `🗑️ Delete` in `ClipboardAdapter.kt`, moving the clip to `PromptDao` and purging from clipboard history.
  5. Mapped `ToolbarKey.COPY` long-press to `KeyCode.PROMPT_LIST` and wired `KeyboardSwitcher.setPromptKeyboard()` in `KeyboardActionListenerImpl.kt` for instant toolbar opening.
  6. Added `KeyCode.INCOGNITO_TEMP_2MIN` and `TempIncognitoManager.kt`: long-pressing the Incognito toolbar key activates incognito for 2 minutes with a timer and feedback Toast. Added lifecycle hooks in `LatinIME.java` (`onWindowHidden()` and `cleanupInternalStateForFinishInput()`) guaranteeing that if the keyboard is closed at any time during temporary incognito, the timer is aborted and incognito is immediately set to OFF.

- **What was actually done**:
  1. Updated `app/build.gradle.kts` debug signing configuration to safely fall back to the standard Android debug keystore when no external `DEBUG_KEYSTORE_PATH` is specified, fixing the compilation errors without committing any keystores.
  2. Replaced `qwerty.txt` symbols with the exact requested layout: Row 1 `% / | = [ ] * ! - ;`, Row 2 `@ # $$$ _ & - + ( )`, Row 3 `* " ' : ; ! ?`.
  3. Configured `more_popups_main.txt` to prioritize Latin French accents (`é è ê ë`, `à â æ á ä`, `î ï`, `ô œ ö`, `ù û ü`, `ç`, `ñ`) directly after key symbols.
  4. Updated `Defaults.kt` `PREF_CUSTOM_CURRENCY_KEY` to `"₹"` so key `d` displays the Rupee symbol by default.
  5. Sidelined predefined secondary layouts to `/sidelined_features/layouts/main/`, restricted `donottranslate.xml` to `Default`, and locked `LayoutPickerDialog.kt` to Default + 1 customizable layout slot.
  6. Rebuilt `MainSettingsScreen.kt` with 3 streamlined parent items: Appearance, Word Engine, and Advanced.
  7. Built `AppearanceScreen.kt` featuring default layout editing, customizable layout slot picker, Currencies quick chooser (₹, $, €, ¥, custom), Toolbar settings, and Desktop Shortcuts modal.
  8. Created `WordEngineScreen.kt` routing cleanly to Text Correction and Dictionaries.
  9. Refactored `AdvancedSettingsScreen.kt` to house Backup & Restore and About.
  10. Created `BackupRestoreScreen.kt` providing Backup All, Restore All, and Import HeliBoard Backup actions with migration guidance.
  11. Updated `AboutScreen.kt` and `donottranslate.xml` to credit HeliBoard and AOSP foundations.
- **How it was verified**: Full project compilation verified via `compile_applet` (exit code 0, build succeeded in 5s).
- **Deviation from requested**: None.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: Ready for on-device verification.

### Receipt: 2026-09-10 03:12:00
- **Requested**: "Implement Mini-Phase A" — Crash Fix & Layout Visibility (Blockers).
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/res/layout/prompt_history_view.xml`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/clipboard/PromptHistoryView.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/KeyboardSwitcher.java`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Replaced `ClipboardHistoryRecyclerView` with standard `androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView` in `prompt_history_view.xml` and `PromptHistoryView.kt`, eradicating the fatal `IndexOutOfBoundsException: Inconsistency detected` crash caused by `ClipboardHistoryRecyclerView`'s swipe-to-delete `ItemTouchHelper` invoking clipboard manager on prompt adapter positions.
  2. Eliminated the redundant second `notifyItemRemoved(pos)` call in `PromptAdapter` delete handler since `promptDao.removeEntry` already triggers `listener.onPromptsRemoved`.
  3. Fixed empty state height collapse by toggling `promptRecyclerView.visibility = View.INVISIBLE` (instead of `View.GONE`) when empty, maintaining layout height and keeping the empty placeholder centered without collapsing to 35dp.
  4. Added `mPromptHistoryView.setVisibility(View.GONE)` and `mPromptHistoryView.stopPromptHistory()` across `KeyboardSwitcher.java` (`setKeyboardView`, `setEmojiKeyboard`, `setClipboardKeyboard`, `onToggleKeyboard`, and `deallocateMemory`), eliminating the ghost overlay over the alphabet/symbols keyboard.
  5. Applied solid keyboard theme background (`Settings.getValues().mColors.setBackground(this, ColorType.MAIN_BACKGROUND)`) when starting `PromptHistoryView`.
- **How it was verified**: Full project compilation verified via `compile_applet` (exit code 0, build succeeded in 35s).
- **Deviation from requested**: None.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: Ready for on-device manual QA of Mini-Phase A and ready to proceed to Mini-Phase B.

### Receipt: 2026-09-10 03:46:00
- **Requested**: "Implement" — Mini-Phase B: ABC Key & State Machine Integration.
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/internal/LayoutDirective.java`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/internal/KeyboardState.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/KeyboardSwitcher.java`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/KeyboardActionListenerImpl.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/inputlogic/InputLogic.java`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/clipboard/PromptHistoryView.kt`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Added `PROMPT(KeyboardState.Mode.PROMPT)` to `LayoutDirective.Utility`.
  2. Integrated `PROMPT` into `KeyboardState.kt`: added `setPromptKeyboard()` to `SwitchActions`, added `PROMPT` to `Mode` enum and mapped `Mode.directive()`, added `Utility.PROMPT -> switchActions.setPromptKeyboard()` in `loadLayout()`, and routed `KeyCode.PROMPT_LIST -> toggleLayout(Utility.PROMPT, autoCapsFlags, recapitalizeMode)`.
  3. Removed early interception of `KeyCode.PROMPT_LIST` in `KeyboardActionListenerImpl.kt` so the keycode is properly dispatched through `latinIME.onEvent(event)` -> `KeyboardSwitcher.onEvent()` -> `KeyboardState.onEvent()`.
  4. Updated `InputLogic.java` so `KeyCode.PROMPT_LIST` behaves as a layout switch event without premature direct view mutation.
  5. Added `KeyboardSwitchState.PROMPT` in `KeyboardSwitcher.java`, mapped `isShowingPromptHistory()` to `KeyboardSwitchState.PROMPT`, added prompt re-launch handling to `onToggleKeyboard()` and `reloadMainKeyboard()`, and passed `mLatinIME.getCurrentInputEditorInfo()` into `PromptHistoryView.startPromptHistory()`.
  6. Updated `PromptHistoryView.kt` to build the bottom row layout via `KeyboardLayoutSet.Builder.buildEmojiClipBottomRow(context, editorInfo)` and bound touch tracking via `PointerTracker.switchTo(it)`, ensuring the ABC key (`KeyCode.ALPHA`) dispatches to `KeyboardState.resetToAlpha()`, which transitions from `Mode.PROMPT` back to `Mode.ALPHABET` and restores the standard keyboard.
- **How it was verified**: Full project compilation verified via `compile_applet` (exit code 0, build succeeded).
- **Deviation from requested**: None.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: Ready for on-device manual QA of Mini-Phase B and ready to proceed to Mini-Phase C.

### Receipt: 2026-09-10 04:02:00
- **Requested**: "Implement" — Mini-Phase C: Visual Parity with Clipboard, Pin to Top, and Storage Mechanics.
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/database/PromptDao.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/clipboard/PromptHistoryView.kt`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Updated `PromptDao.togglePinned()` to refresh `timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis()`, ensuring newly pinned notes immediately rise to the very top (index 0) of the list.
  2. Extracted keyboard `KeyDrawParams` (typeface, label color, text size) from `keyVisualAttributes` in `PromptHistoryView.startPromptHistory()`.
  3. Styled `placeholderView` empty state with `KeyboardTypeface.applyToTextView()`, theme label text color, and scaled font sizing matching the clipboard empty state.
  4. Configured `promptRecyclerView` with keyboard width calculation and scaled left/right side padding derived from `Keyboard_keyboardLeftPadding` / `Keyboard_keyboardRightPadding` attributes.
  5. Styled `PromptAdapter` note cards with `ColorType.KEY_BACKGROUND`, tinted `pinnedIcon` with `ColorType.CLIPBOARD_PIN`, and applied typeface, text color, and label size to prompt text views.
  6. Disabled redundant view haptics (`isHapticFeedbackEnabled = false`) on prompt cards.
  7. Removed disruptive `notifyDataSetChanged()` from the pin popup action in `PromptAdapter`, replacing it with animated `notifyItemMoved()`, `notifyItemChanged()`, and `smoothScrollToPosition()` in `onPromptMoved()` and `onPromptInserted()`.
- **How it was verified**: Full project compilation verified via `compile_applet` (exit code 0, clean build).
- **Deviation from requested**: None.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: Ready for on-device manual QA of Mini-Phase C and ready to proceed to Mini-Phase D upon user direction.

### Receipt: 2026-09-10 04:12:00
- **Requested**: "Implement" — Mini-Phase D: Suggestion Strip Toolbar & Compact Popup Menu for Prompt List.
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/res/layout/strip_container.xml`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/KeyboardSwitcher.java`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/clipboard/PromptHistoryView.kt`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Added `prompt_strip_scroll_view` and `prompt_strip` container to `strip_container.xml`, cleanly isolating the prompt toolbar strip from `clipboard_strip`.
  2. Wired `mPromptStripView` and `mPromptStripScrollView` in `KeyboardSwitcher.java`, displaying the strip and auto-scrolling to the right upon entering `setPromptKeyboard()`, and hiding it cleanly across alphabet, emoji, and clipboard views.
  3. Populated `promptStrip` in `PromptHistoryView.kt` with editing and navigation toolbar keys (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UNDO`, `CUT`, `COPY`, `PASTE`, `SELECT_WORD`, `CLOSE_HISTORY`), styled with `ColorType.TOOL_BAR_KEY` and `ColorType.STRIP_BACKGROUND`.
  4. Wired `CLOSE_HISTORY` key on prompt strip to dispatch `KeyCode.PROMPT_LIST`, toggling out of prompt view and cleanly restoring the alphabet typing layout.
  5. Replaced standard Android framework `PopupMenu` in `PromptAdapter` with a compact themed floating `PopupWindow` featuring HeliBoard vector drawables (`ic_clipboard_pin_rounded`, `ic_edit`, `ic_bin_rounded`) with active keyboard tints (`ColorType.KEY_BACKGROUND`, `ColorType.CLIPBOARD_PIN`, `ColorType.TOOL_BAR_KEY`), 44dp accessible touch targets, and touch-outside dismissal.
- **How it was verified**: Full project compilation verified via `compile_applet` (exit code 0, clean build).
- **Deviation from requested**: None.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: Prompt list overhaul (Mini-Phases A, B, C, D) complete. Ready for on-device user testing.
