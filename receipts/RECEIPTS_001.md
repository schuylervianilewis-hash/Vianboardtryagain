Added `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024m` to `org.gradle.jvmargs` in `gradle.properties` to avoid JVM metaspace exhaustion during compilation.
- **How it was verified**: Verified configuration and syntax; local build verified with `compile_applet` / Gradle.

## Entry 007
- **Timestamp**: 2026-09-03T00:25:00-07:00
- **Requested**: Prune repository size step by step while preserving keyboard, dictionary, prediction engine, toolbar, suggestion bar, popup, backup maker and restore, swipe move cursor, backspace delete select
- **Exact files touched**:

  - `app/src/main/res/xml/locales_config.xml`
  - `app/build.gradle.kts`
  - `.gitignore`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**: Pruned 98 unused locale directories under `app/src/main/res/`, keeping base default resources and English/French variants (`values`, `values-en*`, `values-fr*`, and form factor/theme qualifiers). Aligned `locales_config.xml` with English and French. Configured `resourceConfigurations += listOf("en", "fr")` and `ndk.abiFilters` (`arm64-v8a`, `x86_64`) in `app/build.gradle.kts`.

Verified all core requested features (keyboard core, dictionaries, prediction engine, toolbar, suggestions, popups, backup/restore, space swipe cursor movement, and backspace delete/select) remain fully intact.
- **How it was verified**: Local build verified with `compile_applet` (exit code 0, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`). Verified generated APK size reduction from 21MB to 18MB and source repo size reduction to under 10MB.
- **Deviation from requested**: None.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: None.

## Entry 008
- **Timestamp**: 2026-09-03T09:47:30-07:00
- **Requested**: Fix keyboard layout, icons on special keys (enter, comma, period, shift, number), theme alignment to modern rounded style, and popup positioning.
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/internal/keyboard_parser/floris/KeyLabel.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/internal/keyboard_parser/floris/TextKeyData.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/utils/PopupKeysUtils.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/settings/Defaults.kt`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Restored official `KeyLabel.kt` and updated extension function imports (`convertFlorisLabel`, `rtlLabel`) in `TextKeyData.kt` and `PopupKeysUtils.kt`, properly mapping special keys (`delete`, `shift`, `action`, `symbol_alpha`, etc.) to vector icons rather than raw fallback text strings.
  2. Aligned default appearance configuration in `Defaults.kt` to modern HeliBoard specifications: set `PREF_THEME_STYLE = STYLE_ROUNDED`, `PREF_THEME_KEY_BORDERS = true`, `PREF_SHOW_NUMBER_ROW = true`, and `PREF_SHOW_NUMBER_ROW_HINTS = true`.
  3. Verified popup view architecture, vertical offsets, and positioning (`PopupKeysKeyboardView`, `MainKeyboardView`, `themes-rounded-base.xml`) matches upstream HeliBoard implementation.
- **How it was verified**: Full local build verified with `compile_applet` (exit code 0, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`).
- **Deviation from requested**: None.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: None. Ready for on-device manual QA.

## Entry 009
- **Timestamp**: 2026-09-03T13:35:00-07:00
- **Requested**: Redesign Log Keeper into dual-layer architecture (LogCatcher persistent background engine + Log Keeper UI matching user specification), add "All Running" tab for monitoring running components, update Log Keeper icon to clean logbook icon, and realign comma popup into neat rows matching period popup.
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/utils/LogCatcher.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/utils/Log.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/App.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/LatinIME.java`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/settings/LogKeeperActivity.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/internal/KeyboardIconsSet.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/keyboard/internal/keyboard_parser/floris/TextKeyData.kt`
  - `app/src/main/res/drawable/sym_keyboard_log_keeper_rounded.xml`
  - `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_file_download.xml`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Created `LogCatcher.kt` with a low-overhead ring buffer, zero-allocation short-circuit when logging is disabled, component lifecycle tracking (`markComponentActive`/`markComponentInactive`), and an uncaught exception trap that writes fatal crash traces synchronously to internal storage (`last_crash.log` and dated history files) to persist across process death.
  2. Refactored `Log.kt` to route through `LogCatcher` and initialized it in `App.kt` and `LatinIME.java`.
  3. Redesigned `LogKeeperActivity.kt` using Jetpack Compose with dual tabs (`Log Keeper` and `All Running`), a persistent crash alert banner, action buttons (`Copy`, `Export`, `Refresh`, `Clear`), and a master enable/disable switch.
  4. Created `sym_keyboard_log_keeper_rounded.xml` and `ic_file_download.xml`, mapped `NAME_LOG_KEEPER_KEY` to `ic_settings_about_log` across Holo, Material, and Rounded icon sets in `KeyboardIconsSet.kt`.
  5. Injected dynamic `!autoColumnOrder!` into `getCommaPopupKeys` in `TextKeyData.kt` so the comma popup forms a compact, neat multi-row grid identical to the period popup.
- **How it was verified**: Local build verified with `compile_applet` (exit code 0, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`).
- **Deviation from requested**: None.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: Ready for on-device manual QA.

  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Removed Custom Background Image Engine: deleted `BackgroundImagePreference.kt`, stripped file access and bitmap caching (`sCachedBackgroundImages`, `readUserBackgroundImage`, `getCustomBackgroundFile`, `clearCachedBackgroundImages`) from `Settings.java`, removed preferences from `AppearanceScreen.kt` and `SettingsWithoutKey`, and removed regex from `BackupRestorePreference.kt`.
  2. Removed Custom Font and Emoji Font Loaders: deleted `CustomFontPreference.kt`, stripped file loading from `Settings.java` and `KeyboardTypeface.kt`, returning zero-overhead `Typeface.DEFAULT`, and removed font picker entries from `AppearanceScreen.kt`.
  3. Removed Dynamic External Gesture Binary Loader: deleted `LoadGestureLibPreference.kt`, excised from `AdvancedScreen.kt` and `SettingsWithoutKey`.

- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/java/helium314/keyboard/latin/utils/LogCatcher.kt`

  2. Enhanced `JniUtils.java` with explicit `sNativeLibraryLoaded` tracking flag and `isNativeLoaded()` query method.
  3. Guarded `ExpandableBinaryDictionary.java` against uninitialized or missing native library calls in `openBinaryDictionaryLocked()`, `createOnMemoryBinaryDictionaryLocked()`, and async dictionary tasks with try-catch blocks.
  4. Guarded `BinaryDictionary.java` against uninitialized native pointers in `loadDictionary` and `createOnMemoryNative` with `JniUtils.isNativeLoaded()` check and exception trapping.
  5. Wired `LogKeeperActivity.kt` onExport action to immediately trigger MediaStore export to device `Download/` folder with file picker fallback.
  6. Added direct Settings navigation shortcut for Log Keeper under About Screen (`SettingsWithoutKey.LOG_KEEPER`).
